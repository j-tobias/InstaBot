The social graph is a collection of nodes (representing entities such as users, pages, groups, and events) and edges (representing relationships between nodes such as likes, comments, and friend connections).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Facebook Graph API, developers can access data and perform actions on Facebook, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieving information about users, pages, groups, and events, including their name, profile picture, posts, and other metadata.\n",

It also supports a variety of authentication and authorization mechanisms, including OAuth 2.0 and access tokens, to ensure that user data is protected and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Facebook Graph API is a powerful tool for developers who want to build applications that interact with Facebook data and features. With its rich set of endpoints and powerful customization options, the Facebook Graph API allows developers to create engaging and interactive experiences for users on the Facebook platform.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Instagram Graph API is built on top of the Facebook Graph API, and requires that developers have a Facebook developer account and a Facebook app with an approved Instagram professional account connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Instagram Graph API, developers can access data and perform actions on Instagram, such as:\n",

    "## Instagram Private API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instagram Private API is an unofficial API for interacting with Instagram services. Unlike the Instagram Graph API and Instagram Basic Display API, the Instagram Private API is not provided or supported by Facebook or Instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instagram Private API is built by reverse-engineering the Instagram mobile app and web application, and is not endorsed or approved by Instagram. As a result, its use is not recommended and may violate Instagram's terms of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, the Instagram Private API is used by some developers and third-party services to access Instagram data and perform actions that are not supported by the Instagram Graph API or Instagram Basic Display API.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Instagram Private API, developers can access data and perform actions on Instagram, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieving information about media, including photos and videos, posted by public and private accounts.\n",
    "* Managing comments and likes on media posted by public and private accounts.\n",
    "* Sending direct messages to other Instagram users.\n",
    "* Discovering new accounts and media through Instagram's search and explore functionality.\n",
    "* Accessing metadata such as follower count, following count, and profile information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instagram Private API provides a wide range of functionalities beyond what is offered by the Instagram Graph API and Instagram Basic Display API. However, it comes with significant risks, including potential account suspension or termination, legal consequences, and potential harm to the Instagram community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the use of the Instagram Private API is strongly discouraged, and developers are recommended to use official Instagram APIs provided by Facebook instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________\n",
    "## Instagram Basic Display API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instagram Basic Display API is a publicly available API that allows developers to access limited Instagram profile information, media, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instagram Basic Display API is designed for use cases that do not require full access to an Instagram account or the ability to publish content to Instagram. It provides read-only access to a user's basic profile information, including username, profile picture, and biography, as well as media posted by the user and metadata associated with the media.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Instagram Basic Display API, developers can perform the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authenticate users with Instagram and obtain an access token.\n",
    "* Retrieve a user's basic profile information, including username, profile picture, and biography.\n",
    "* Retrieve media posted by a user, including photos and videos.\n",
    "* Retrieve metadata associated with media, such as captions, comments, and likes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instagram Basic Display API uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization, ensuring that user data is protected and secure. To use the Instagram Basic Display API, developers must create a Facebook app and link it to an Instagram Business or Creator account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Instagram Basic Display API is a useful tool for developers who want to provide users with basic Instagram functionality without requiring full access to their accounts. It provides a secure and reliable way to access limited Instagram data and metadata, and is well-suited for a wide range of use cases, including social media management, analytics, and marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________\n",
    "## Facebook Marketing API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Facebook Marketing API is a suite of APIs that allows developers and advertisers to create and manage Facebook ad campaigns programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Facebook Marketing API, developers and advertisers can perform a wide range of actions, including:\n",
